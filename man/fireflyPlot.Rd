\title{Plot minimum distance between cell types as a spatial heatmap}
\usage{
fireflyPlot(
  data = NULL,
  label = NULL,
  ct1 = NULL,
  ct1.lwd = 0,
  ct2 = NULL,
  ct2.lwd = 0,
  fovs = NULL,
  ct1.colthresh = 0.99
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a Seurat object containing Kandinsky data (`KanData()`)}

\item{label}{character string specifying the variable name to be used to defne cell annotation groups}

\item{ct1}{cell type A label}

\item{ct1.lwd}{linewidth to use in plot for cell type A boundaries}

\item{ct2}{cell type B label}

\item{ct2.lwd}{linewidth to use in plot for cell type B boundaries}

\item{fovs}{list of fov IDs to include in the analysis. If NULL, all fovs will be considered for the analysis}

\item{ct1.colthresh}{quantile threshold to apply to the distance colorscheme for cells belonging to cell type A in the spatial plot. For instance, if `ct1.coltresh = 0.99`, any distance greater than the 99 percentile will not result in a lighter or darker cell color}
}
\value{
a list object containing the data frame with the distance measurement plus a spatial plot reporting cells A colored according to their distance from cells B
}
\description{
Calculate the shortest distance between cells belonging to two different groups, and visualize distance measures of the first cell type
}
\details{
For two groups A and B of cells of interest, this function will calculate the minimum distance from each cell of type A to cells of type B.
Find the closest cell of type B for each cell of type A, then plot the corresponding euclidean distance as spatial heatmap of cells (type A/B)
with the color scale based on the euclidean distance of cells A to the closest cell B, and with cells of type B colored in white to resemble a 'firefly' effect
